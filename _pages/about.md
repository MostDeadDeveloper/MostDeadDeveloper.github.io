Hello I am Carl,  a professional with experience as a  researcher,  data engineer & analyst mostly working on problems and  applications of geospatial and career-related text data for more than 3 years now. 

I also recently graduated with my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.

Throughout my career I mostly worked with non-profits, government agencies, small and large-scale businesses.

I also contribute to open source initiatives I feel interested in such as increasing language representation through the Aya Initiative  and contributing to the Python user base through Python related  Events such as WFH Pythonista and Pycon!

For more information, please check out my [CV][]
