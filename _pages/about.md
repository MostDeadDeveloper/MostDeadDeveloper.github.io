Hello I am Carl,  a professional leveraging three years of experience across roles as a software engineer, data analyst, Python tutor, and researcher. Throughout my career I mostly worked with non-profits, government agencies, small and large-scale businesses.

I am also currently engaged in learning more about conducting machine learning research and pursuing a particular research topic on this field. This is done by participating in fellowships such as the Whitebox AI interpretability Fellowship of [Whitebox Research](https://www.facebook.com/WhiteBoxResearch) and the Fatima Al-Fihri Predoctoral Fellowship from the [Fatima Fellowship Program](https://www.fatimafellowship.com/).

Outside of work, I  dedicate time as a core volunteer of PythonPH, contributing to the expansion of the Python user community in the Philippines.

For more information, please check out my [CV](/cv/).
